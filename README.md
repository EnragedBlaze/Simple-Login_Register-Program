Passwords can be user-defined or generated with options for added complexity. Separate Admin authentication, as they can view all accounts. For educational use only.

## **Educational Python Authentication and Registration System**

This Python program is a simple command-line authentication and registration system designed solely for educational purposes. It serves as a practical exercise for learning fundamental concepts in Python programming, such as file handling, user input, error handling, and basic password generation.

## **Key Features:**

* User Authentication: Users can log in with existing accounts or create new ones.
* Account Storage: Account data is stored in a plain text file ('Accounts.txt') for demonstration purposes.
* Password Customization: Users can choose to create their own passwords or request the program to generate one with various character types for added complexity.
* Admin Access: An admin login option allows administrators to view all registered account information, demonstrating basic access control.
  
Please note that this system is intentionally kept simple and may not meet the security standards required for real-world applications. It should not be used as a secure authentication solution in production environments.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it for educational purposes, or use it as a starting point for learning Python programming concepts. For more secure and production-ready authentication solutions, consider professional libraries and frameworks.
